This repository contains a command-line implementation of the classic Snakes & Ladders board game written in C.
The game simulates all core mechanics, including:

    Random dice rolling
    Player movement across the cell board
    Ladders that move the player up
    Turn-by-turn player progression
    Win detection when a player reaches the goal

The program is fully CLI-based, simple, and lightweight — ideal for beginners learning C programming and game logic development.

To compile the program, navigate the relevant directory in the terminal

type the command :  gcc main.c logic.c -o maze
run the program : ./maze > log.txt
